# book-info-scraper
ruby scraper and cli to pull a book's author, title, series, and release date from its goodreads page

It uses the first goodreads search result for the term the user enters to provide info. It is useful
for finding getting some of author/title/series/release date when you have some others already.

In the future I'd like to add series support, clean some output edge cases (special characters, multiple authors),
and polish the interface


Hash output?

added blurb, average, ratings
format blurb
